                        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

                        <p>I am an undergraduate Computer Science student on track for a 1st degree, which I have worked towards whilst managing a team at a clothing store a couple of days a week. I have a keen interest in  design, as well as analysing data to find patterns and possible outcomes. My career goal after university is to become a software engineer, particularly with projects involving AI. I am currently looking for a part time job that will allow me to continue working on my studies in my spare time.</p>
