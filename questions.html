                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><i>The project talked about in this question can be viewed from the <a href="https://jaymassey98.github.io/portfolio/reports/Utilising-Data-Structures.pdf">Data Structures</a> report.</i></p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I was working on a project where I <b><i>designed a process scheduler</i></b> using whatever algorithm I desired, so long as I had <b><i>prioritising tasks</i></b> set to one of three levels on initialisation. These values could later be changed though, in order <b><i>to avoid task stagnation</i></b> if required. I used priority scheduling as a base, <b><i>using an aging system</i></b> alongside that added points to processes that have not yet been completed. When a process was initialised, its age was tracked until it had been fully processed. When its age was greater than a set limit, its points total meant it had reached the top of the priority queue. This limit was not set in stone; rather it was <b><i>calculated by the average burst time</i></b> of the completed processes.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This meant that whilst I was not able to use actual bursts in the calculations, I was able to use an estimate based on the real data that was being passed through the scheduler. <b><i>The more processes that arrived in the system</i></b>, the more data it had to work out what the average burst time is, and therefore <b><i>the more efficient the scheduler became</i></b>. This was particularly helpful in working out the order of processes when longer processes entered the system. <b><i>If a process was taking longer than the average burst time</i></b>, the system knew that it must be very close to competition and therefore <b><i>it continued to be processed for the final few bursts</i></b>, rather than switching to a new process.</p>

                        <p><b><i>This prevented long process starvation</i></b>, as slightly longer processes were allowed to finish being processed, when previously they would not have with default process scheduling. These solutions aided me in <b><i>decreasing the average waiting and turnaround time</i></b>, resulting in more processes being completed quicker than they were before. Whilst the brief only required hard coding 5 processes into the system as it was mainly testing my algorithm application, the way it works would allow it to be expanded to an infinite number of processes. Therefore, if I were to reattempt this task in the future, I would change the processes to be dynamic rather than only allowing 5 processes in the final code.</p>

                        <newline><b><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Describe a software project that you worked on, and how you organised it.</p></b></newline>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><i>The project talked about in this question can be viewed from the <a href="https://jaymassey98.github.io/portfolio/reports/Agile-Management-Report.pdf">Agile Management</a> report.</i></p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I have worked on various software projects ranging between 1 to 6 people on the team. My largest project in terms of deliverables is an application prototype that I developed in university for a client in a team of 3. The client was a biology teacher who wanted a fun and interactive way of teaching one of their modules to their KS3 students (Years 7 to 9), demonstrated through a short playable demo.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The project went through all the stages <b><i>from conception to the completion of a playable demo</i></b>, which was ready to be uploaded and used as a first introduction level. This was <b><i>managed through many agile methodologies</i></b>, such as <b><i>scrums and sprints</i></b>, allowing my team consistent interaction and feedback with the client. <b><i>Each person</i></b> in the team was <b><i>allocated set tasks</i></b> based on their skillset, decided as a team in the sprint meetings, <b><i>in order to plan and organise the work and judge our weekly progress</i></b>.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Each week, I arranged a sprint meeting with my team and the client to discuss various topics of the week. Towards the beginning of the project, this included <b><i>testing relevant competition in the market</i></b>, creating a list of our <b><i>technical specifications</i></b>, as well as a <b><i>usability test plan</i></b>. As time went on, we started <b><i>drafting the initial UI</i></b>, developing a <b><i>storyboard</i></b>, and <b><i>utilising our previous market research</i></b> to help us in choosing our art style. In the following sprints, we developed <b><i>use case diagrams</i></b>, produced <b><i>high-level design architecture</i></b>, and monitored <b><i>accessibility considerations</i></b> that could affect product usability.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">As each sprint went by, my team and I would discuss with the client how each stage of the project was developing. For example, our <b><i>draft</i></b> UI turned into a more <b><i>defined</i></b> UI, and eventually a <b><i>finalised</i></b> UI. Once all of the elements of our project had gone through the process of finalisation, me and my team <b><i>tested the application with our audience</i></b> of KS3 students. This allowed us to make final tweaks, alongside the general debugging of any potential code issues, before finally submitting our created demo.</p>
