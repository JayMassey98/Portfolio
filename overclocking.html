                        <p>I have experience in designing highly efficient PC systems, built with a mixture of both new and used components. All voltages and timings are manually adjusted based on results from specific stress tests, where several groups of variables are changed using the binary search method for extremely efficient testing, minimising the time needed to ensure a stable system with an increased relative performance.</p>

                        <h2>Benchmarking</h2><hr>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.618em;">After running an initial benchmark via <a href="https://www.userbenchmark.com">UserBenchmark</a>, the CPU, GPU and RAM ratings were <a href="https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/39913412">60.9%, 52.6%, and 40.9%</a> respectively (replacing an ancient 28.9% GPU). The scores showcased are relative in comparison to the current mainstream component, meaning the average new PC with newly released mainstream parts will have a score of 100%. Whilst the way the website calculates the scores is often disputed due to the way it promotes certain companies and impedes others, it is nevertheless a great tool for comparing between a pre-overclocked and a post-overclocked system with the same parts.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1.618em;">After tweaking various clock speeds and individual voltage lines, the CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSD ratings became <a href="https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/41951420">76.4%, 59.8%, 61.8%, and 86.6%</a> respectively. This shows a performance percentage increase of 25.5% for the CPU, 13.7% for the GPU, and an incredible 51.1% for the RAM. The only “new” components were the previously mentioned GPU that was originally released in 2014, and an SSD for faster boot and load times. These performance increases allowed an almost 10 year old computer system to be able to run games released in 2021 not only at 1080p with 60fps, but with high settings enabled too.

                        <h2>Test Procedure</h2><hr>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">When tweaking any system to be different than originally intended, stability is never guaranteed; this is a potentially serious issue if not treated properly. To make sure any changes will not cause the system to become unstable, a 30 minute stress test is applied after any change. As a general rule, most timing issues (anything clock speed related) cause an error in the first 5 to 10 minutes. To rule out any voltage related issues, voltages are initially set to be slightly over their maximum recommended specifications for 24/7 usage; values that are considered safe for some short-term tests but not for permanent use.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Once all timings are pushed as far as they can go for each possible variable, the next step is to lower the voltage of each component. This is done by lowering one voltage at a time to be slightly below its specified value, and gradually increasing the voltage until no errors are detected after 2 hours of stress testing. Work on other projects is usually done during these longer tests, however an eye is kept on the temperature readings just to make sure it never exceeds the maximum threshold. Once no errors are detected in this time frame, the remaining voltages are then manually adjusted, tested and verified.</p>

                        <p>After each voltage, clock speed and RAM timing is manually adjusted, a final 24 hour stress test is run at the end. This is done to confirm that the system is free of any errors and can therefore be considered fully stable. A log of each previous stress tests is kept in the event it is unsuccessful, so that it is easier to identify the culprit should this final stress test fail. This is far more efficient than running countless 24 hour stress tests on each component all throughout the process. The final result after overclocking and validating its stability is a fine-tuned system that is far more efficient than was ever originally intended.</p>
