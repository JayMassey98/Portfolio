                        <div class="list">

                            <p>Alongside my passion for programming, I also enjoy a variety of physical activites, such as bouldering and strength training; I find being physically active helps offset the sedentariness of coding. As shown in my <a href="overclocking.html">Overclocking</a> project, I also like to tweak systems to make them run at a much higher efficiency than intended. As well as the skills shown in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, I have other skills such as the ability to drive, entertaining, live presenting, first aid trained and proficiency in Microsoft Office, especially Excel.</p>

                        <h2>Languages</h2><hr>

                        <p>My main programming language is C++, followed closely by C and C#, allowing me to further develop my knowledge of various lower and higher-level concepts respectively. I also have experience in Java, Python, and various assembly languages on both desktop systems and embedded microcontrollers.</p>

                        <h2>Questions</h2><hr>

                        <p>Various interview-based questions about my experience can be found in the <a href="questions.html">Questions</a> page. These include a recently faced software challenge, projects managed, and other coding-related questions.</p>

                        <h2>Contact Details</h2><hr>

                        <p>You can send an email to <b>jaymassey98@gmail.com</b>, and I will respond back to you once I am available.</p>
